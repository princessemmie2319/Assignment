Phishy story 
     Once there was a girl named Anna she was always using her computer to shop online and suscribe to memos on sales.
     Anna wasn't the smartest so she never checked if any were real. On this special day she suscribed to get a magizine but this
     this website asked for so much information. Letting it go she answered every question. Later on that day she was told she couldn't
     use her credit card because of fraud sadly she lost all her money to that one company.
